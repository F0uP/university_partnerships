# university_partnerships
This is a project for the service learning seminar of the university CAU in Kiel, Germany.

### Idea

Partner universities of any chosen university are sometimes very hard to find. Project between these universities are split into many different sub-pages of content, faculties, etc. This project wants to solve this problem by creating an environment visualizing different universities, their partner universities and the project they plan/have with each other. 

### Implementation

To get the data needed, the program uses a web crawler searching for keywords and adding the information to the intern database (manually adding data is also possible). The UI consists of a large world map showing the current universities the crawler found.
